#DESCRIPTION 

This command can be invoked as `redux init` or, through a symlink, as `redo-init`.

The init command creates and initializes a .redo directory,
which holds the redo configuration and database files
and also demarcates the root of the redo enabled project.

The redo-init command must be invoked before any other redo commands can be used
in the project.

The command is idempotent and can be safely invoked multiple times in the same directory.
